    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use case we will consider how we might train with pretrained embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretrained embeddings can allow our model to include information from additional modalities (for instance, we might want to grab CNN descriptors of product images). They can also come from other models that we train on our data. For example, we might train a word2vec model on the sequence of purchased items by a customer and want to include this information in our retrieval or ranking model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use cases are many, but this particular example will focus on the technical aspects of working with pretrained embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a synthetic version of the MovieLens 100k dataset and emulate a scenario where we would have a pretrained embedding for each of the movies in the dataset.\n",
