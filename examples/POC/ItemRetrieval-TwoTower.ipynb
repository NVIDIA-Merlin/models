    "## Building Retrieval Models easily with Merlin Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In large scale recommender systems pipelines, the size of the item catalog (number of unique items) might be in the order of millions. At such scale, a typical setup is having two-stage pipeline, where a faster candidate retrieval model quickly extracts thousands of relevant items and a then a more powerful ranking model (i.e. with more features and more powerful architecture) ranks the top-k items that are going to be displayed to the user. For ML-based candidate retrieval model, as it needs to quickly score millions of items for a given user, a popular choices are models that can produce recommendation scores by just computing the dot product the user embeddings and item embeddings. Popular choices of such models are **Matrix Factorization**, which learns low-rank user and item embeddings, and the **Two-Tower architecture**, which is a neural network with two MLP towers where both user and item features are fed to generate user and item embeddings in the output. Such models can be efficiently served by indexing the trained item embeddings into an **Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)** engine and during inference scoring user embeddings over all indexed item embeddings within the engine.In this notebook we will build a Two-Tower architecture for item retrieval.\n"
