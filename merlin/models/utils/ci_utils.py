    Check which backends need to be tested based on the changed files in the current branch.

    This function scans the current branch of a repository and identifies files that have changed.
    If a change is detected in a backend file, the corresponding backend alias is added to a set.
    If a change is detected in a shared file, all backend aliases are returned.
